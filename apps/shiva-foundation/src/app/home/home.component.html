                <h3>Our <span class="text-orengered">History</span></h3>
                <p>Shiva Foundation was formed seeing a need for energetic,nonprofit work for old age home, providing
                  them with basic amenities and a homely habitat. We've consistently grown since then, all thanks to the
                  helping hands of this amazing community!
                  Realizing the needs of poor children, we decided to extend this place to an orphanage as well because
                  this brought more life to the place by connecting caring warm love of old people to the sheer
                  innocence of children. We also provide education to the poor children which is a necessary step for
                  the future of the tiny tots and our mighty nation.
